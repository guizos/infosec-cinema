# InfoSec Cinema

InfoSec ciema is a film-based teaching activity that uses commercial films to teach information security. An InfoSec Cinema session consists of the screening of a movie and a discussion of approximately one hour of duration. For its initial version, we have prepared ten InfoSec Film Guides. They are hosted in this repostivoty under the `movies` folder but can be accessed also on the repository corresponding  [website](http://guizos.github.io/infosec-cinema).

## Preparing an InfoSec Cinema session

Before preparing an InfoSec cinema session you need to make sure that your activity is covered by the relevant copyright legislation in your country. Once you have done that you just need to select a film and play it! We developed a supporting [presentation](https://guizos.github.io/infosec-cinema/files/Presentation.pdf) from our screening of Rogue One. 

## Contributing to InfoSec Cinema

Contributing to the InfoSec Cinema database is very easy. Just clone the repo, add (or update) as many films as you want and create a pull request. If you want to add a new movie you will have to also add the name of the json file to the `movies/list.json` file.
